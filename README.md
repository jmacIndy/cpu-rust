# README file for *CPU* project

This is a virtual CPU. It *builds* a CPU in an object, including the
registers, flags, memory, stack, and heap.

It loads, reads, and executes an assembly language that I created just
for this CPU.

## Background
When I was learning computer science at Purdue (not programming ...
computer science), my favorite part was the systems programming
(operating systems, compilers, etc.). That was 30 years ago. Upon
graduation and getting out in the "real world", I have not touched these
skills yet.

So, I'm doing it now. Just for fun. And maybe I'll turn this into a
blog or something.

Why am I working on a virtual CPU, instead of just using an existing
cheap board or computer?
* I want to build up from the very bottom, as if I was building the
CPU.
* I am in between houses and living in an apartment. I exclusively use
my laptop because I have room for nothing else. Don't want a board lying
around that I have to hookup to my laptop or external input/output
devices.
