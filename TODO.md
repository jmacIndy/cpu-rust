# TODO
* Complete rewrite in Rust
* Still to convert:
   * ops module 
   * bios module
   * write assembler
* Figure out:
  * handle overflows and underflows
  * handle signing
  * print function should use interrupts
  * add boundary checks
* Add capability to create and print strings
* allow LOADs and SETs to specify register, instead of 4 ops
* merge LOADs and SETs to reduce ops
* allow INCs and DECs to specify register, instead of 4 ops
* Write unit tests
* Expand from 8-bits to 16-bits
* Beyond: write OS
* Compiler for C into assembler
